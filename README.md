# PYTHON WORDLE

Josh Wardle's *Wordle* written in Python. Runs in the command line. The code is horrifically written, overcomplicated to the point of illegibility, and about as far from *pythonic* as it's possible to get. But it works. Perhaps I'll refactor it one day...

The dictionary file used contains come very interesting 5-letter words... Vimpa, anyone?
